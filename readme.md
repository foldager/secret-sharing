Input/output from app:
    Secret: str()
    splits: str(b64(checksum()))

Work with:
    bytes


    encode 

Operations

split(s)
join(s1, s2)

encode: b -> b
decode: b -> b

# Python Strings
encode: string -> bytes
decode: bytes -> string
```

```console
% ./secret.py combine txhEAu8Dm9OdZ5iKzPukpDy4vIP1NqMOuA== +3crac9h/rv0CfyquJPBhE/Q2efVxjyqFQ==
